# AF â€” Animation Framework

AF is a small JS library that uses GSAP (and potentially other JS animation libraries) under the hood, and allows you to animate HTML elements using data attributes with simple syntax.
Main promise is to make it easy to create animations of small to medium complexity, with an easy-to-read syntax and a minimal amount of code.
